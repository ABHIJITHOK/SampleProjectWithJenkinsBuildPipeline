### Quoting code:
#### You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
#### To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

### Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link in brackets [], and then wrapping the URL in parenthesis ()
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Relative Links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.
A relative link is a link relative to the current file. 
For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, 
the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:
[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/ConsoleApp2Readme.md)

### Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.
- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson


### Ordered Lists
To order your list, precede each line with a number.
1. George Washington
2. John Adams
3. Thomas Jefferson

### Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.
To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, 
you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, 
until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
   - Second nested list item
2. Second list item
   - First nested list item
   - Second nested list item
     - Subitem
